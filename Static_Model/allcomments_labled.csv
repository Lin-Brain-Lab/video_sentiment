All's I know was...He was Ex British S.A.S & His name was Pete. He worked as a Barber & then Lawyer, being born in South Manchester.  

However, he is still to this day, known to be alive amongst the knowledge of the local Council & some locals who know who he is. 

He has the best street to live on, as from when he moved in. The local Drug Dealers must have moved away. There's, no drugs, robberies, house burglaries or cruelty to animals. These statistics,  had dramatically reduced in their area, when the family moved in. 

I would LOVE to know the S.P. on this guy, but the Public know who he is & no one will talk?? 

The public in England, seem to protect their SPECIAL FORCES Soldiers & give no quarter to those who pray.

He will do absolutely anything to provide for his friends, who he considers to be his family. It is so gut-wrenching to see his final moments, yet we know he has died doing what he loves most, which is defending Harry Potter. It is so beautiful when Harry wants to have a proper funeral for Dobby and, in the books, it is made clear that he wishes Dobby could have the kind of extravagant funeral that Dumbledore had.

I pulled her out and when I tried to set her down she just tipped and fell over without stopping herself while moaning. I could tell she was in a lot of pain but had no clue what was going on. I sat down and pulled her into my lap and my girlfriend came to the door and I looked at her desperate for something... anything to do and said help me. What do I do? I just sat there and told her it's ok, and pet her until she died about 2 minutes later. I'd never felt so completely helpless and unsure of what to do.

882,@rogue7100,0,"This really meant something in the end. Had it not been for their love for each other, Spider-Man would have died and the people of New York and possibly other cities would've been subject to the terror and fear spread by the likes of Electro and Green Goblin, not to mention that includes the possibility of many more people getting killed other than Peter because of the lack of a hero being present. Gwen's death was not unnecessary and it was not meaningless. If he left her alone, sure he would have been keeping his promise to Gwen's father, but Gwen would have lived a more lonely and depressing life as she would have surely heard of Spider-Mans death. And for those that are questioning how Spider-Man would even die, well, allow me to explain. Don't get me wrong, I have full faith in Spidey being able to overcome obstacles, but Electro is the most powerful villain he's faced thus far (in the Andrew Garfield movies), and there are also these variables to think about:

1 - He needed Gwen's help to take down Electro, he didn't do it by himself, and this was him in peak physical and emotional health, so
2 - Gwen leaving and their permanent break-up would still be on his mind, and as a result would have detrimental damage to his emotional health, further affecting his physical health as well, slowing down and lowering his fighting capabilities to a drastic level
3 - Even if he somehow, someway was able to beat Electro he would have gotten defeated by Goblin who comes right afterward and could have easily taken him out considering Peter would be in immense physical fatigue AND mentally unwell.

So in the end, had they chosen solitude rather than love, then Peter would have died instead of Gwen and quite possibly many more people could have died afterward with the absence of Spider-Man as a result of his death, as well as leaving Gwen to a depressing and lonely life in another country where she doesn't know anybody and knows that the boy she loved died protecting the city just as her father did. Gwen's death was, sadly, a necessary one in order for Peter and many more people to come out alive from that unfortunate incident, so salute to her sacrifice. Thank you to whoever reads this, it means a lot to me, I just wanted to give some insight to those who believed her death meant nothing as it really does and although it honestly just makes it even sadder, at least her death was not, by any means, in vain. They both knew the risks, and she chose to die loving rather than live apart, it just goes to show how true their love was for each other...",2021-08-31T05:17:05Z,224,sad_video1_spiderman (1).xlsx

890,@TheWhovinerd-1963,4,"This scene still makes me emotional. her head hit the floor and bounces back and the snapping sound is the sound of her spine and neck breaking. If you pause the video as she hits the floor you can see her head and back all bending back as you hear the crack. It’s because Gwen had already fell to far for him to catch so by the time his net caught her she was already dead. It’s a really devastating yet effective scene because you see peters web turn into the shape of a hand ✋🏻 as it reaches out to catch Gwen. This symbolises Peter is trying to catch the last thing in the world he loves most as she is his last hope of love. I’ll admit while this film wasn’t great this scene hit me hard especially when you realise how badly this effected Peter. Seeing him desperately cling to her dead lifeless body shows how much he loved her and wants her to stay alive. We know her neck is broken because, even as he holds her her head continues to hang back. The even more devastating thing is her last words to him was “Peter” which would no doubt haunt him for the rest of his days. Xx",2021-12-26T14:18:00Z,189,sad_video1_spiderman (1).xlsx

The new Tom Holland Spider-Man is amazing but as much as it sucks I think we need to see him fail to save someone he loves. It'll propel his character to that higher and emotionally deeper level. Marvel can't have 9 more movies circulating around a character like Spider-Man (especially a younger rendition) without having him go through physiologically consequential traumatic events. I don't think the current Peter (Far From Home) truly understands the quote I mentioned above just yet. Having someone like MJ, or even Aunt May in the current films die in similar fashion to how Gwen dies here would serve as a great catalyst for his growth as a hero. This character evolution (if done well) is one that'll make Peter live up to RDJ's legendary portrayal of Ironman. A true successor, just a regular human but gifted with immense potential. Burdened with great responsibility. A hero we can all sympathize with and aspire to be.",2019-07-20T03:43:32Z,153,sad_video1_spiderman (1).xlsx

1042,@josephgillotti676,0,"My theory is that she was dead before the web caught her. That split second before where she closed her eyes. Falling from that great a height and gaining speed as you fall, your heart would stop before the point of impact. There’s speculation about this concept that if you jumped off the top of the Empire State Building; assuming you had a straight path all the way down, you would be dead before you even hit the pavement. So obviously this scene wants to portray Spider-Man as thinking that he accidentally killed her, but realistically, she was gonna die either way.

For real though, the acting is top-notch. And I remember, with the original “Spider-Man”, some people giving Tobey Maguire crap for being an “ugly crier”. But let’s be realistic: NO ONE looks pretty when the cry over the death of the woman they love more than life itself. And it’s a testament to Andrew Garfield’s acting ability to convincingly reduce himself to a blubbering mess over Gwen’s death. 

Andrew Garfield may not be my personal favorite Spider-Man, but he certainly had his shining moments throughout these films.",2021-09-04T15:00:38Z,30,sad_video1_spiderman (1).xlsx

Not only Andrew's performance is literally AMAZING, but it also showcases Spider-Man's life at it's very core; always putting his life on the line to protect other people while also sufferring the pain from the loss of his loved ones, in this case the death of the woman he loves. Peter's romance with Gwen was one of the film's primary themes and it culminates in what is arguably one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the history of superhero films. I like Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man and the original film trilogy with Tobey Maguire will always have a special place in my heart, but when it comes to the TASM films, I think that Sony did a great job at adapting the comics, using elements from both the mainstream Earth 616 version as well as the Ultimate Comics continuity. So when it comes to Spider-Man: No Way Home, I really hope that we get to see both Tom Holland , Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield  joining forces !",2021-11-21T17:51:34Z,14,sad_video1_spiderman (1).xlsx

3736,@mac7133,0,"Why must this scene be necessary? Why do people who look different from the ""ideal"" have to feel bad and try to hide it? Why can't we all just ignore our differences on the outside and focus on being the best people we can on the inside? The world isn't fair. There's always some sort of expectation to be met in regards to financial status, health, popularity, and most of all, looks.  I don't know why those things matter, as long as we are all kind hearted individuals who treat others with the respect and dignity that they deserve, regardless of appearance. We all should persevere through our physical differences and help others, and for the love of God, if someone you know is struggling mentally, physically, or in any other way, help them out. Is it really that hard to ask someone ""Hey, are you okay?""  No, it is not. Augie does a fantastic job not letting his differences get in the way of him being a normal kid, despite the space helmet at the beginning, but struggling is just a part of life, it sucks real hard sometimes, but it makes the good times that much better.  That's my rant.  Thank you for your time.",2019-11-13T07:12:27Z,6,sad_video2 (1).xlsx

3864,@dcfrank4904,0,"If only what Auggie was told was true... 'Why am I so ugly' That was a question I asked so many times my entire life, even when I was Auggie's age. It never seemed to make sense as people were practically insistant that I wasn't ugly, or that looks matters little and it's what's inside that counts, and I really wanted to believe that. But, my experience in life taught me otherwise.... Life is indeed unfair... had I been told that when I was younger, then as much as it would have hurt then, in the long run, would have probably saved me alot of pain...

I'll answer your question Auggie.  'Why am I so ugly?"" same reason as mine, there is no reason. We simply crapped out with the genetic lottery... It's unfair, it sucks, and it's what happend. Though there is one thing in your favour, that is just make up, And you Auggie don't actually exsist, And the actor playing youi is Jacob Tremblay, a very normal, even good looking boy, who will do doubt have a very normal life ahead of him. I don't have that advantage, unfortunately I actually exist, and the heart warming message of the very controllable nature of the film.. is sadly untrue.",2018-07-31T21:56:18Z,34,sad_video2 (1).xlsx

I remember watching this movie when I was about 16, 17, and not understanding most of it, cause my mind is more to the artistic and humanity side... I remember it would just shut down everytime someone explained something too mathematical or scientifical, because I would just not get any of it!
So, watching this with my family, I would always have the feeling like ""This movie is about STAY: stay with your family, stay with your loved ones... Don't ever leave or anyone that is important to you...!""! It's funny, 'cause it has such more deep meaning inside of it, but all my heart could feel was ""Stay... Stay...""... I guess that's just what we needed from it after all...

P. S.: At the time, I recognized Mackenzie Foy, but had no idea I was in front of Timothée Chalamet, one of our current young adult celebrities that we look up to...! Funny how you recognize the person you became when you look back at old memories: it was all already there, just reaching for its firsts gasps of light...!",2024-08-18T21:49:39Z,0,sad_video1 (1).xlsx

After first week, 1176 years went by on earth.

After first month, 5040 years..

After first year, 61.320 years..

And lets assume that Cooper lives at least to 80 years old. He has all the equipment and stuff to do so.

He is 35 when he lands on the Brands planet and lives another 45 years... so.

Watching this scene hurts, having all the sadness and happiness of watching your child grow, someone you put so much care and time into and are anticipating all the great things they will experience, and watching it all flash by in three 2 minute videos all while it was just a 10 minute watch time… this scene when I first watched it I didn’t really understand to the full extent the care and love a father had for his child, and I don’t fully understand it now, but watching it again brings unfathomable appreciation for parents who actually care about their children, and I can really imagine what it would be like to never get to experience my baby brothers life, and to have my time with him cut short.",2023-05-27T08:37:36Z,0,sad_video1 (1).xlsx

4722,@sorryifoldcomment8596,4,"You know what actually makes this scene so powerful for me? The fact that both Anne and Matthew have physical tears on their face! Anne especially even gets red in the face and looks & sounds exactly how I look and sound when I choke up mid sentence and start crying. 1:05 This is when my eyes uncontrollably fill with tears, regardless of how much I try to stop it. 

I am confident that even if everything else was identical in this scene (including the acting, I mean literally everything), BUT there were no visible tears on their faces...I would not burst into tears while watching this scene - which unfortunately for my sinuses, I always do. 😢😪

I don't even feel that emotional when I do, it's truly a reflexive response. I almost feel like it's a similar reaction to seeing  another person yawn and then yawning myself?

The reason I'm ranting about this is because so few movies that include scenes of characters actively crying (just like in this scene), also bother to put physical tears on the actors faces. Most don't even bother with dropping a single molecule of water on the cheeks right before filming (although the single tear cliche is even more annoying at this point if it's too obvious that it didn't start in the eyes). Not saying this is easy, just that these are the facts when it comes to reactions to these kind of scenes!
Most directors just have the actors mime crying, by scrunching up their face and making crying noises with their vocal chords...which unfortunately is simply impossible to perfectly mime without the presence of real water. As someone who cries and knows exactly what I sound and look like, and also as someone who has personally witnessed & observed other people actually shedding tears as well (so I know I'm not unique when it comes to this lol)...we all know what it looks like when our eyes well up, our throats kind of knot, how the water rarely/never stays on the face - at some point it's going to be in your nose & making you sniffle, and then going down the back of your throat so it interacts with how your vocal chords sound, etc. If you're like me, this immediately fucks up your sinuses and you can always tell just by hearing my voice and looking at my reddish & puffy under eyes, that I'm in some stage of shedding tears.    

So with that in mind and as someone who can uncontrollably start shedding tears watching a scene in a movie, like this one...it's painfully obvious when the director didn't bother making their characters look like they're actually shedding tears! It takes me out of the movie, kills my investment, and never ever gets me to cry. It's a true shame how many emotional and potentially powerful scenes are squandered like this - and if there wasn't real water involved in this one, I'd definitely add if to the list. 

I know it's not easy (and I would love to know exactly how Nolan got the shots of Anne in the beginning and Matthew throughout). When it comes to scenes in other movies where characters mime ""crying,"" I do not blame the actors, I blame the director. 
Honestly, I believe that if I had to shoot a scene where I cried on camera...I could make it look real and even probably shed real tears and all, really pull it off...but only if I was given the chance (and necessary tools) to do so. The director would have to actually care and let me do it. If the director just threw me into the scene, gave me one second to start miming crying, then accepted the first take without bothering to get one with real tears...then I don't think I'd be able to magically produce them in one second and obviously if the director actively doesn't want tears in the scene (maybe because it would interfere with my ability to look beautiful and repeat crappy dialogue I guess, but the interference/change in speaking is exactly what immerses me in scenes of real crying, etc.), then it's still not my job to change that. Actors/everyone has to follow orders, whether I thought it was dumb or not. I do recognize though that it would be an easier shoot and easier for everyone involved if all I had to do was mime crying in one take and that's the end, onto the next scene. Ultimately, the only people who have a less easy time with the scene are the people in the audience...people like me. 😒 Because I can tell immediately. I have never ever reacted to scenes of fake crying and I've definitely never uncontrollably shed tears while watching a scene of characters fake crying - who can be still be acting their heart out just as competently as Anne & Matthew in this scene...but unfortunately, with no water/liquid physically added to their face & around the eyes, etc. it doesn't matter. 


The only crying movie scenes I shed tears at that don't have real tears on screen are animated movies lol. The Lion King is a big one. Damn can I not control the tears when Zimmerman's track kicks in, especially when young Simba's voice cracks - and cries real tears I guess technically but they're animated drawings of tears of course, and I would shed tears at that scene even without the animated tears - since lions don't cry tears like humans lol. (Obviously I did not cry at all when watching the awful remake Disney did, for a myriad of reasons. Don't worry, I didn't pay for it, just watched the scenes on YouTube for free.)

Ok that's my rant. It's always struck me as odd how few movies have realistic crying, when it's a whole lot easier than doing something like blood, etc. Shout out to Chris Nolan for making sure the crying looked realistic as possible in this scene, and of course shout out to the acting and everything/everyone involved. 👍 Even though my sinuses are going to be water logged and miserable for the next hour, because human anatomy is a cruel joke. 😔",2022-04-02T16:43:17Z,10,sad_video1 (1).xlsx

4769,@ConnectionSpaceReal,4,"Theres this song that just changed my life forever. Its not like other songs, its not pop, rock, punk, none of those. i dont know how to explain what it feels to be listening to it. Its just a endless loop, it never ends it makes you cry, anger, depression, but its not ment to. It just does. While you may think this is just a regular song and you may ask why i am so big about it. Its just reminds me of my past. And my future, you will know what i mean when someonething happens when you realize everything isnt easy, and we wont be here forever. we are so lucky to be here. Its been a million years since we were created. And i ask, why arent we on mars yet? We are just staying here in this planet. Under the atmosphere. Nobody wanting to go farther. Just staying here. Waiting for death while the sun devours us in 7 billion years. We should be farther into our galaxy. Maybe even farther into our universe. I know, we do have NASA & SpaceX, Rosmoscomos, blue orgin. ETC. but thats just 1% of us. We need to work together, We need to be willing to explore more. Not just the sea, Not just our planet, not just our solar system, nor star nor galaxy, but our universe. We need to go father than ever before. More than anyone has ever explored. We are willing to land on other bodies of solid rock, or even dust. We need to explore more before we fade away, or are we? Thats why i want everyone to help. So we can make that 1%, to a 100%. We are not the only living beings. We could be stuck in a 3D altered dimension controled by other beings. To prove that, we need to reach out of our solar system, out of our galaxy, out of our universe. And explore whats beyond. Listen, and you’ll see what i mean maybe. And lets explore more, remember do not go gentle into that good night. Its day one of exploring more.

4857,@willdorten6867,0,"This is just non-sense. Time is not constant, it isn't variable, because it simply does not exist. Our perception exists, but the farther it reaches out it loses validity. Time is not in question, because time does not exist. Our perception of light is the only thing that exists in that threshold. The only thing that's changing is distance, gravity, and relativity. Time is the absence of science, in the form of misguided institution, and should be deemed null void. It's simply a dot that someone looked at, and others looked at, and we compare those dots, and we define that as time. Everything is moving, and the dot that someone else looked at, is not the same dot that the rest looked at. There is no such thing as the dot itself, therefore time doesn't exist.

You can see the joy and pride on Coopers face watching his son grow up to become a dad, to more of turmoil and grief listening in on the bad news. And then the sheer self disappointment and sadness that overcomes him when his daughter comes on kinda guilt tripping him to come back.

It’s a powerful section of the movie. I would compare it to a level of castaway in how absolutely brilliant it was.",2021-09-14T04:55:45Z,4,sad_video1 (1).xlsx

4869,@sahityabk,0,"2001 A Space Odyssey is looked at more as a piece of art. Interstellar is going to be remembered as an experience. Literally every aspect of this movie, whether its the acting, direction, cinematography, the editing, the sound design, THE MUSIC, set design, and writing(debatable)...is firing on all cylinders. It represents the peak of filmmaking. It also has 2 scenes that I think will go down in history as some of the greatest scenes put on film; watching his children’s messages scene and the docking sequence.

I remember seeing this movie in IMAX on the first day of release, planned it perfectly to make sure i got there early to get center seats and not too close to the screen. Right after Cooper pleads to Dr. Mann not to dock and then Mann blew himself up, Cooper accelerates towards the Endurance and Dr. Brandt then asks Cooper what he's doing, and he just says...""docking"" (Cue Hanz Zimmer's score). I lost my shit in the theater, I got goosebumps and literally leaned forward and audibly said pretty loudly ""what...the...fuck!?!"". As the scene went on I remember thinking, Nolan... you crazy bastard , you just cranked the intensity up to a 10. Then the music tipped it over to an 11. That moment, that sequence with that music and the sound just blasting. Sensory Overload...I will never forget the experience. 

Seriously, if you sat down and really thought about ""what"" this movie is about, like really thought about all its themes, all its layers of depth and what its trying to say, your gonna come to only one conclusion. Its about Everything.",2021-08-23T22:59:15Z,195,sad_video1 (1).xlsx

He time travels to watch himself in the 3rd person

April 2017
Living in a different dimension of the same existence

Addressing a conglomerate of people who live in wealth & lead this social matrix
Where everyone else is oblivious
Working for below minimum wage standards compared contractual finances that make easily several hundred thousand to millions of $ +

Whether it was in school, in class, even outside our school, we’d never see eye to eye. My argument is that even though the ending is unrealistic, the movie is so much more than just that. The cinematography, the effects, the music, the story, the acting, the themes, literally everything in it is a total masterpiece. It’s okay to sacrifice a little bit of realism, I mean then again, it is just a movie. But that’s not the worst part.

My friend watched the movie once and only once in his life... when he was 12. And he put his entire judgment on that.

I keep telling him to rewatch it since he’s much older now, but he refuses. Apparently the ending to him is just too far off to watch the whole thing. You can’t even begin to understand my frustration whenever we talk about this.

No one understands him, but I do. In fact he could go to a restaurant to celebrate his birthday, this is an experience I’ve never had, never went to a restaurant out of my own will. I suffered from depression twice and still can’t see any bright in my future or current. This also reminds me of a news of a man eating a birthday cake along on a bus and crying, I cried that time as well. In fact that even sadder, because Mr Bean is just an actor but that person was not acting but in his real life which is a death circle he could never escape, neither can me.

7641,@mattgerrish908,3,"These ants are called Siafu. They are a type Army ant. They really do behave like this. They can digest prey even as they tear it apart. If you see a whole swarm of them on the Move do not even step on one because if you do every single one of the entire swarm will appear to fuse like some giant superorganism and attack like one giant being. Notice how Irina tried to get up high and they appeared to turn into a hand and get up to her? Anything that stands in their way will be overwhelmed and killed. The way that Soviet Soldier died with all the ants going into his mouth, that's how they actually kill people - by suffocating us to death and then eating us. These ants are also nomadic, meaning they only stay in one location temporarily, the longest amount of time they have stayed in one area is only 3 months. The main reason they move is because they decimate the whole ecosystem by eating nearly every living thing within the whole area they occupy. These army ants can even easily outnumber red imported fire ants. These ants are not native to South America like this movie depicts, they are native to Northern parts of Africa and parts of Asia near India.",2016-08-30T23:49:03Z,36,scary_video1 ants.xlsx

Recently, I decided too re-watch all the Indiana Jones Movies, and it's like everyone says, the first three are the prime Indiana Jones, and this one was a little washed up, but I think people gotta realize the fact that Harrison Ford, and the classic casts, and staff even decided to comeback and make a fourth film took a lot of courage, knowing that they weren't in their prime, and we gotta appreciate that. Like always the storyline was great, the characters were amazing, and the soundtrack always top tier. I remember when this movie first came out, there was massive amounts of hype, and it's basically what helped revive Indiana Jones, and massive credits too that. Honestly a great movie, with adventure, comedy and action. Was a great way to start the year, and lets hope the fifth movie goes great, I'll never forget the early comic books of this series though.
