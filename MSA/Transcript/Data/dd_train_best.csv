 | The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . |

 | This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy .

 | Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . |
 | Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! |
 | All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! |

 | Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . |
 | You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . |
 | It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . |
 | Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . |
 | I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . |
 | I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . |
 | Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? |
 | No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . |
 | Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . |
 | I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? |
 | I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . |

 | Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? |
 | Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . |
 | I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . |
 | Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! |
 | Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . |
 | How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . |
 | You have always been so soft , Dave ! |

 | In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . |
 | Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? |
 | Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . |

 | I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . |
 | That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) .

 | Me ! Me ! |
 | Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs .

"[|Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? |
 | Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . |
 | I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? |
 | One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! |
 | When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? |
 | You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . |
 | What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? |
 | One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . |
 | So I need plenty of space for this exercise . |

 | 500 pieces . |
 | No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . |
 | All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . |

 | We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . |
 | No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . |

 | We need to find a good realtor . |
 | Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . |

 | Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . |

 | Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . |
 | So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? |
 | It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . |
 | And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? |
 | Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . |
 | Why ? |
 | That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . |

 | Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . |
 | If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . |

"[|Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . |
 | What is it , Mrs . Wang ? |
 | It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . |
 | Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? |
 | Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . |
 | Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . |
 | The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . |
 | As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . |
 | I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . |
 | The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . |
 | We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . |
 | That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . |
 | To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . |
 | Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . |

 | No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . |
 | Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? |
 | Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . |
 | We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . |
 | Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? |
 | First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . |
 | I see . What else ? |
 | We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . |
 | Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . |
 | Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . |]",[2 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 1 3],"[0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]"

 | Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? |

 | A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . |

 | First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . |
 | Oh , OK . Wow ! |
 | OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . |
 | Wow . That sounds really good . | | Mm , it is . |
 | Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? |
 | Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it .

 | Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . |
 | Yes , thank you . |
 | I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? |
 | In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . |
 | Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? |
 | No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . |
 | From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . |
 | I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . |
 | You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . |
 | No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . |
 | That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? |
 | I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . |
 | Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? |
 | No , can you tell me about it ? |
 | Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . |
 | I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? |
 | I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . |

 | I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . |
 | We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . |
 | I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . |
 | We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . |
 | I'll come to that . My proposal is |
 | As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? |
 | Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? |
 | Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . |
 | You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . |
 | On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . |

"[|Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . |
 | You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . |
 | Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? |
 | OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . |
 | Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . |
 | All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . |
 | That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . |
 | Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? |
 | That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . |
 | I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . |
 | No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . |

"[|Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! |
 | Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . |
 | Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . |
 | Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . |
 | Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! |
